# service management
Final project of the Java Web Developer course by Coders Lab, a web application for
Industrial machinery field service management. My objectives:
 - solve real problems that I have encountered at job
 - apply the knowledge from the course and expand it to include such topics as Spring Security
 - communicate with external APIs


Companies providing service of industrial machines must include in the cost of their service the 
journey of the service technician from his place of residence to the customer. This is usually 
done manually by checking the distance e.g. in Google Maps. The application automates this process 
using Google Maps API. Having the customer's address and the serviceman's address in the database, 
while creating a service request the application automatically reads the distance, which will be 
used to issue the final invoice.
